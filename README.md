# Creating-Images-In-Processing
I created this program for students in my Processing class. It was made with the intention for students to make rapid iterations of their project and eliminate the tedious aspects of creating images in processing. 

This program empowers the user to create images in the Processing programming language, using only mouse clicks. After hitting enter, the program generates the code necessary to create that image in the console below.
